  description: LabLearner, developed by Manzavision using Unity, is a tool for creating
    VR training applications. It guides users through professional scenarios and
    evaluates their performance with metrics like errors, execution time, and precision.
    This feedback helps users improve continuously. My role was to upgrade the engine,
    add features, and ensure cross-platform compatibility with new devices. These
    slides outline the technical details and tools used.
