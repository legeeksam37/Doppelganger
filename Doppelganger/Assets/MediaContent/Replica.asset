  title: Replica
  description: Replica, developed by Manzalab, is an engine designed to simulate
    realistic interactions with professionals. Users engage in scenarios where they
    choose appropriate responses, and the professional avatar reacts dynamically
    to enhance realism. After each scenario, users receive feedback highlighting
    strengths and areas for improvement to refine their approach. My role was to
    upgrade the engine, add features, and ensure compatibility with WebGL and VR
    across all devices, enabling cross-platform functionality.
