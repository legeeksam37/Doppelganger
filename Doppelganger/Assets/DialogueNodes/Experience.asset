  dialogueText: Do you have any profesional experience ?
  dialogueContent: Absolutely ! I began my professional journey with a three-month
    internship as a Full-Stack Developer, where I gained hands-on experience in the
    end-to-end development cycle, working with front-end and back-end technologies.
    Following that, I completed a six-month internship at Capgemini as a Unity Developer.
    In this role, I focused on immersive application development, deepening my knowledge
    of Unity and 3D rendering. And Most recently, I completed a year-long apprenticeship
    at Manzavision as a Software Engineer specializing in Unity application development.
    In this position, I was responsible for designing and implementing applications
    tailored to diverse platforms, including VR headsets, WebGL, and mobile devices.
    My role also involved refining application performance, ensuring cross-platform
    compatibility, and optimizing for different user experiences.
